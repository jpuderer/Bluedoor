Bluedoor
=====================

Overview
--------------

This project contains code for a project of mine, where I reversed engineered
and electronic door lock, and paired it with a Bluno Beetle (Arduino compatible)
Bluetooth board.  This application controls the lock over Bluetooth-LE.

You can find more details here:

This project contains both the Android application source, and the Arduino source.


Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

The source for the Bluno Beetle is in the Arduino folder, and can be compiled
and installed from the Arduino IDE (using board type: Arduino Uno).
